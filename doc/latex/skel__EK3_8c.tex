parallel 3D binary curvilinear skeleton based on ends 



\subsection{Detailed Description}
parallel 3D binary curvilinear skeleton based on ends 

{\bf Usage:} skel\_\-EK3 in.pgm nsteps [inhibit] out.pgm

{\bf Description:} Parallel 3D binary thinning or curvilinear skeleton based on ends. The parameter {\bf nsteps} gives, if positive, the number of parallel thinning steps to be processed. If the value given for {\bf nsteps} equals -1, the thinning is continued until stability.

If the parameter {\bf inhibit} is given and is a binary image name, then the points of this image will be left unchanged.

{\bf Types supported:} byte 3d

{\bf Category:} topobin
